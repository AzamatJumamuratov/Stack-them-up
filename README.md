      <h1>Stack Them Up</h1>
<p>Stack Game is a minimalist reaction-based arcade game. Press Space to place blocks as precisely as possible and build your tower higher and higher!

If you align a block perfectly, you’ll get a streak — and with it, a score multiplier: x2, x4, x6, x8, x10!
Test your reflexes and try not to miss.

Press Escape to pause the game.</p>
<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
<p>Download the game archive and extract it to a convenient location using your preferred extraction tool.
Open the extracted folder and run the .exe file to start the game.</p>
